## Current status

Phase 0, Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, and Phase 4 are complete. Phase 5 is in progress and must stay scoped to the reusable public site shell until runtime/browser proof closes it.

## Near-term sequence

```txt
Phase 5: Base Layout Shell (in progress)
Phase 6: Static Landing Page
Phase 7: Local Native PostgreSQL Foundation
```

## Patch discipline

Every phase must ship with:

- implementation or documentation artifacts matching that phase scope
- progress state update
- append-only progress log entry
- spec file
- closure file
- golden evidence
- smoke checks
- professional local CI lane with all new phase tests and golden checks wired before closure
- `git apply --check` proof for the generated patch
